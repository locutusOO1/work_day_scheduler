## Summary:
A work day scheduler created using dynamic HTML. A work day is assumed to be from 9am-5pm. Time blocks are styled differently for past, present, and future. Save/Delete functionality allows the data to be retained after a browser refresh.

## Technology Used:
* Bootstrap for responsive layout
* jQuery for dynamic HTML & CSS
* setInterval to display the current date/time
* localStorage with JSON to retain the time blocks after a browser refresh
* 2 dimensional array to hold time blocks
* Moment.js to handle operations with date/time
* Font Awesome to display icons
